# Final Project Talking Points
## Slide 1
My name is Janet Huffman and my team consisted of Mandy McCabe, Tracy Gadient, and Carina Beauvais.

## Slide 2
The topic we chose showed the relationship between political views & trust in the media.  We selected this topic because bias in the media is a hot topic right now and we thought it would be interesting to see how different demographics would affect media usage & political views.  We got our dataset from Kaggle and it looked at the response of over 1000 americans to find out their demographics, media usage & trust in the media.

## Slide 3
THe questions we hoped to answer were to determine an individual's political stance based on responses to questions in the survey.
