# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We will be utilizing Pandas to clean the data and perform exploratory analysis. We will then use Python for further analyzing the data.

## Database Storage
We are using Postgres for our database.

## Machine Learning
We are using the SciKitLearn library to create a classifier. Our training and testing setup uses random state. 

## Dashboard
We intend to use Tableau to display our findings and present our data visualization dashboard to the class.
