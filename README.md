# Final_Project
## About the Data Source
The dataset looks at the responses of over 1,000 Americans to find out about their demographics, media usage, and trust in the media. 

## Why did we select this topic?
We selected this topic because bias in the media is a common topic in current events.  We thought it would be interesting to see how different demographic inputs would affect media usage and political views.  

## What We Want to Answer
We would like to use the dataset to determine an individual's political stance based on their responses to the other questions in the survey (gender, age, income, preferred media outlets, etc).  We plan to use Postgres for our database, Tableau for our visualizations, and categorical supervised machine learning to predict our target value (political stance). 

## Communication Protocols
A group message was setup in Slack to easily share ideas and files amoungst the group members.  Additionally, Microsoft Teams will be used to setup ad hoc meetings to be able to have virtual discussions outside of class.  Phone numbers were also exchanged so that we will be able to call or text another team member in the event of an emergency.
