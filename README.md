The most important features for predicting political leanings were:
1. "Strongly Disapprove of the way Donald Trump is handling his job as president"
2. Respondents who chose "Fox News" as their choice for a news outlet that they trust when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly
3. Respondents who chose "CNN" as their choice for a news outlet that they trust when it comes to reporting the news fully, accurately and fairly
4. Respondents in the 60+ age range
5. Respondents who use and iOS Phone/Tablet as their Device
